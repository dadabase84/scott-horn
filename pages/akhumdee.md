# Memories with Scott Horn
My first in person 1:1 with Scott was back in 2018 when Scott visited Chicago.
We talked about our career path and agile practices.
My daily interaction with Scott is limited to Lodging Daily Trading Meetings over bluejeans and other guild meetings. 
Despite being in different location, what I know to be true about Scott Horn:
 
1) He has a cool name Scott Horn
2) He is a bold and caring servant leader
3) He appreciates being challenged by his directs and conversely he will also challenge you.

## Things only Scott Says
**At DTM or any meeting**
Borrowd from Srurthi. It's true Scott says these a lot 
- "Since you brought it up why don't you take action on it?"
- "Why are we still supporting this <insert name of any old codebase>?"
- "Can you prove it?"



## What I Will Miss About Scott
- Hearing Sruthi giving Scott a hard time :-)
- Scott's servant leadership

## Anything Else?
- Good luck in your new adventure Scott
- Best wishes from Chicago
