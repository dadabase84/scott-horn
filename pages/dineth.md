Principal Maker and fellow table flipper

## Memories with Scott Horn
- The day I turned up for my official Wotif interview, Scott spent his time nudging me to tell others about things I mentioned to him in our coffee chat. Was very bizzare, but I knew I had the job.
- Scott started a thing in his LT that "Dineth always says 'I think you're wrong'" which really popped a bubble in everyone's head. They started noticing it... which led me to stop saying it. What a troll. I'm totally bringing this back!!
- His Bundaberg shirt, despite his fat salary.
- Our daily visits to Bunker, complaining about every employee we come across... the early 11.30am lunches.
- Ja Tiger cocktail sessions - first round's on you!
- Time I spent a week+ at his family home in US, sleeping among a bunch of unicorn posters and a unicorn lamp. I am into unicorns now btw. Thanks...
- Our weeks long fights over stupid work stuff
- Book recommendations weekly - seriously, I WILL READ FIRST 90 DAYS... This Harry Potter book is fking long. JUST... WAIT.
- Walking around Vegas with Sruthi and Scott - felt like I was 16, Sruthi was 14 and Scott was... well, 42
- Our secret #club-tableflippers slack channel with Daman and Sruthi (cat's outta the bag now...) - we will deprecate this channel now, without a replacement in production in classic Expedia style
- Scott dressing up like Captain America to work Xmas party... but refusing to dance (seriously, priorities?)
- Standing in line for 45m in San Francisco outside a Chinese restaurant with Clarissa and seeing him hangry
- Realising his need for eggs for breakfast
- All the times I had turned up to 16/10 in my temperature and urgency scale and Scott had to sit there listen to how no one was doing their jobs
- The time we made a little workshop together called "Maker Academy" and went around the world making a team of Makers out of this team (Scott was the first person I convinced of having a workshop and got sponsorship). We spent the last few years building the greatest team I've had an opportunity to work in.

## What I Will Miss About Scott
- I'm not sure if I would ever work with a leader who made more hard decisions that Scott Horn. I will miss this.
- Moving fast
- Debating for hours about conceptual things - I often feel like I am talking to Wendy from Billions
- Flipping tables as a team... let's face it - we had a crazy style of work all this time (this good cop bad cop thing):
  - Dineth tells person X they're doing a sh*t job
  - X calls Scott and tells him Dineth is "unbecoming"
  - Scott asks X about events (he already knew)
  - X realises they're wrong
  - Scott has his way.
- Level of trust to make an insane play
- Blaming me for PWA :facepalm:
- Asking me to work on the decks he's supposed to (I really enjoyed these)
- Mentorship
- Incredible trust and belief in his people and their willingness to change

# Not goodbye
When I look back in the last 10 years of my career, I can't think of anyone who's had this much impact in me as you have. I genuinely believe that I am where I am today because of all the knowledge, wisdom, conversations, 1:1s, fights, debates, decks, book recommendations, texts, slack threads, meetings, kind words, tough love and belief you've given me. I would never forget nor would I ever lose touch. You have my eternal gratitude. You have a friend in me and a professional partner in me for life. I will do my best to continue to further the lessons and direction you've given me. 

Thank you. And I look forward to visiting you in Denmark in your very hygge house.
