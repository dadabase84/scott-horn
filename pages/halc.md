## Memories with Scott Horn
There are too many, but here are some that come top of mind.  

I recall a meeting the MIT team setup with LShop for something.  At the time, the problem with America was not showing up on time or ending meetings on time :).  So, to prove his point, Scott got up and left the room right before the top of the hour and while someone from MIT was in the middle of explaining something to him.  Literally, just walked out.  The look on their faces was priceless.  ROFL!  

Ok, so last year while visiting San Franciso for the Maker Academy, Mr Horn thought it would be "fun" to run a live debate between myself and Bharati on the subject of "ownership".  As you know, Scott loves ownership.  BTW, I won that debate in case you didn't know.  

The Roadtrip.  It sounded crazy back then and looking back now I still can't believe we did it.  Probably not something I'll ever get a chance to do again with a group of co-workers.  I'll always look back on it and smile.  

Many trips to Bake's in order to solve all of our problems.

## Things only Scott Says
- *This is the problem with America...*
- *Can somebody tell me why...??*
- *Kaayshe*

## What I Will Miss About Scott
- Scott's ability to take a punch from us all.  He's one of few managers I've been able to sit in a 1:1 with, disagree with on almost everything, and then 10 minutes later go to happy hour with no hard feelings.  Also, some of the servant leadership meetings where we all gang up on him have been epic.

## Anything Else?
I've told this story to a few people, but when Scott visited the U.S. for his interview I got a chance to meet with him. Sorta strange to interview your future boss. When it was my turn to provide feedback to the group I told the group I think I'd be able to learn from him.  It turns out that was true. Too bad it was mostly what not to do. :)
