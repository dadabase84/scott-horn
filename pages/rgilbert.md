# Rob Gilbert

That dashing EM in Brisbane.

## Memories with Scott Horn

I still remember my hiring experience with Scott at Wotif. Straight talking, no-nonsense.

## Things only Scott Says

- In response to "what are some good things about America?": "There's a few things they say that make more sense, like 'sidewalk' where as in Australia we say... ugh I forget now" (Answer: footpath!).

## What I Will Miss About Scott

- Always feels accessible and will take the time to listen.
- Still has his fingers on the keyboard.
- Has his eye on the mission, always learning, and coaching.

## Anything Else?

- Wishing you, Cat and the kids all the best on your journey to Denmark and beyond. Give us a shout when you eventually get back down under - I'll be hiring ;)
