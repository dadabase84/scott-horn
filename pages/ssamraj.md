## Memories with Scott Horn
- We started in LShop at the same time - Scott, you moved to Seattle from Brisbane and thought it was fantastic; I moved from Chicago and thought it was just ok
- Our first 1-1 when I said `cooking` and he heard it as `cocaine` :facepalm:
- The pep talks you gave me when I was ready to give up on OSI, and people
- George the Emu, you gave me to replace the human punching bag
- When you got "hangry" in Las Vegas, and Dineth had to play adult and dragged us all to dinner at 5pm
- The minimum of 4-5 hours we'd spend at Bake's four times a week

And this one is my favorite:
> Running into you at the LA Fitness pool, and actually **kicking your butt swimming laps**! :swimmer: in 4-different strokes.<br> I believe the ratio was you doing 1 lap for every 2.5 of mine?

## Things only Scott Says

- Why are we still supporting this *<insert name of any old codebase>*?
- Why does *this* person still have a job?!
- Since you brought it up why don't you take action on it?
- It's all good in theory, but can you prove it?
- If they can't create a simple GitHub page, with markdown, why do they work in technology?
- :imp: In Australia, we have screw-top (twist-top) wine bottles, why doesn't :us: do that?
- :imp: In Australia, you wouldn't have to wait this long to get a table or have good service

## What I Will Miss About Scott
- Telling him that he's wrong and arguing about it endlessly
   - especially about the fact that **corked wine** is usually better and  more expensivewine [Read the reasoning here](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/01/02/259128689/cork-versus-screw-cap-dont-judge-a-wine-by-how-its-sealed)
- Insisting that he walks on the left side of the pavement/sidewalk and explaining why he does it every single time
- Trying to convince me that I'll like visiting Australia, despite all the snakes and spiders that will eat you alive
- Visiting Bake's Place every day after work (or the fancier French bistro!)

# Anything Else?
Scott, I've said this before and I'll say it again, it was a pleasure and privilege to have known you as a colleague, boss (Sly Stalone not considered), and friend. I will miss you.<br> I don't think I've met anyone in my career that challenges me as much as you have, and it has been an experience in (im)patience, cussing, near-physical altercations, and genuine fun.<br>Every conversation I've had with you has been thought provoking, a time for *whinging*, table-flipping, and really just engaging that I walked away every time having learned something new.

Thank you for always indulging my rants, questions, and skepticism. Until the next 8 hour drinking, arguing session, "Cheers mate!"
> P.S. Do learn Danish. It's a fun language and has a plethora of proverbs and phrases that are right up your alley! :smirk:
